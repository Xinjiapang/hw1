P&amp;E Homework 1
In the file, I changed the radius about the bubble from 5 to 150. That makes the bubble tiny and huge at the same time. Then I added some code that when the mouse is pressed, there will be a new bubble come out. 
On the color of the bubble, I change the normal color from yellow to pink. The code was changed from(255, 220, 200, 200) to (255, 0, 100, 100). The green was removed and added less blue and transparency. I also remove the outline of the bubbles. For the shifting color, I changed to green. I changed from (255, 220, 200, 200) to (0, 200, 200, 400). The red is removed and add more transparency. And I also made the bubbles' motions more vigorous.
